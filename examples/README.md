A collection of examples.

Please start by reading the [quickstart](https://github.com/daizoru/node-evolve/tree/master/examples/quickstart.coffee "quickstart"), because it explains a lot of things.

then when you feel ready, feel free to browse others examples!

They are divided in three categories: from basic usage, to more advanced demos.

## Basic examples

These show usage of the [basic functions](https://github.com/daizoru/node-evolve/tree/master/examples/basic "basic functions")

## Medium examples

These show how a simple evolve-based program looks like. 

See the cool [petri](https://github.com/daizoru/node-evolve/tree/master/examples/medium/petri/README.md "petri") example, or browse the list [here](https://github.com/daizoru/node-evolve/tree/master/examples/medium/README.md "here").

## Advanced examples

Not available yet, but later this folder will contains more complex examples using external libraries to do advanced hings.
