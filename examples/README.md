# Examples

Please start by reading the [quickstart](https://github.com/daizoru/node-evolve/tree/master/examples/quickstart.coffee "quickstart"), because it explains a lot of things.

## Basic usage

These simple examples show [how to use the API](https://github.com/daizoru/node-evolve/tree/master/examples/basic "how to use the API")

## More demos

These show how a simple evolve-based program looks like. 

See the cool [petri box](https://github.com/daizoru/node-evolve/tree/master/examples/demos/petribox/ "petri box") demo, or browse the list [here](https://github.com/daizoru/node-evolve/tree/master/examples/demos "here").

## Machine code generation

These show how node-evolve can explore parameters or build new algorithms
written in compiled programming languages.

There is special project called [node-cello](https://github.com/daizoru/node-cello "node-cello") which you can use for generating
simple [C](https://github.com/daizoru/node-evolve/tree/master/examples/templates/c.coffee "C") or [OpenCL](https://github.com/daizoru/node-evolve/tree/master/examples/templates/opencl.coffee "OpenCL") programs.

(warning: this is experimental and still work in progress! the C and OpenCL syntax are not fully implemented yet).


## Advanced examples

Please see [node-substrate](https://github.com/daizoru/node-substrate/tree/master/ "node-substrate") project.
