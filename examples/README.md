# Examples

Please start by reading the [quickstart](https://github.com/daizoru/node-evolve/tree/master/examples/quickstart.coffee "quickstart"), because it explains a lot of things.

## Basic

These simple examples show [how to use the API](https://github.com/daizoru/node-evolve/tree/master/examples/basic "how to use the API")

## Medium

These show how a simple evolve-based program looks like. 

See the cool [petri](https://github.com/daizoru/node-evolve/tree/master/examples/medium/petri/ "petri") example, or browse the list [here](https://github.com/daizoru/node-evolve/tree/master/examples/medium "here").

## Advanced

To be defined - these should be more complete samples applications,
showing real-life use cases (eg. solving hard problems, using distributed
computing for large simulations, mutating GPGPU code using templating, mutating calls to third-party C or Java libraries..)
