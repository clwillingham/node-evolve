# medium

These are examples of average complexity that use node-evolve to do fun things.

## Bacteria

A demo of a self-replicating program.

## Petri

Like bacteria, except it runs in a node-cluster.

This is a [must-try](https://github.com/daizoru/node-evolve/tree/master/examples/medium/petri/README.md "must-try") if you are looking for live node-evolve action!
