# petri

Skeleton of a petri-like environment to mutate code

## Install dependencies

    $ npm install

## Run the experiment

    $ npm run-script run

## Description

This experiment will generate individuals in the box/ directory.

The system may evolve until it reaches an equilibrium between mutation, reproduction and lifespan rate.

Typically, average mutation rate will increase until it stabilize to a low value
(actually, after the forking rate stabilize to a high value).
